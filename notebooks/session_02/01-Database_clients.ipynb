It won't occur frequently, but if you run into weird or inexplicable problems when turning SQL into DataFrames, try running the SQL using lower layers to isolate the problem.\n",

In the example below, we'll use the `pandas.read_sql()` function to read the results of an SQL query into a data frame._\n",
