# Applied Data Analytics training program â€“ Social Benefit Programs (2017)

The [Coleridge Initiative](coleridgeinitiative.org)'s Applied Data Analytics training program focused on social benefit programs.

## Class Overview and Projects

The Coleridge Initiative Applied Data Analytics Training Program is designed to equip public policy professionals with advanced computer science and data science skills. The program provides a hands-on introduction to data analytics topics ranging from basic SQL and Python coding to running and interpreting machine learning models. Application to real-world issues is key to the organization of the program.

## Data Available for Class

For both class notebooks and team projects, participants of the Applied Data Analytics Training Program have access to several datasets, including confidential micro-data hosted on the secure Administrative Data Research Facility platform. The datasets available included:
- Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS)
- Illinois Department of Employment Services (IDES)
- New York City Center for Innovation through Data Intelligence (CIDI)
- Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program data
- Census LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)
